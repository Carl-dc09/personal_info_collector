Program #1: Creates a txt file where it stores the person's information given. It can be a single or multiple entries and only 1 (one) txt file will be generated for storage.

Program #2: This program is a search engine where it uses the txt file generated by the Program #1 to find the information that's being searched. 

NOTE: Use the Program #1 first before the Program #2. Without a txt file generated by the Program #1, the Program #2 won't give you any information.
